# Web applications
- [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) List of UNIX binaries that can be used to break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks.
- [ExploitDb](https://www.exploit-db.com/) Exploit databse. Can be used to find scripts for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
- [WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS/winPEASbat) Windows Privilege Escalation.
- [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) Linux Privilege Escalation.
- [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/welcome/readme)
- [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/)
- [nmap](https://nmap.org/) Start almost everything off with an nmap scan
- [nikto](https://www.kali.org/tools/nikto/) After your nmap scan start a nikto scan
- [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/) Reverse shell generator


# Binary exploitation
- [Nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/) Intro to binary exploitation
- [Vulnberable Binaries](https://github.com/jjamme/vulnerable_binaries/) Collection of vulnerable binaries written in C. Covering topics such as buffer overflows, and format strings.
- [Pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) Pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library.
- [Pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) Used in conjunction with pwntools can be very powerful for binary exploitation.
- [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) Decompiler, disassembler useful for reverse engineering.
- [libc Database](https://libc.blukat.me/)
- [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) Lets you search your gadgets on your binaries to facilitate your ROP exploitation.
- [Ropper](https://github.com/sashs/Ropper) Use ropper to display information about binary files in different file formats and you can search for gadgets to build rop chains for different architectures

# Digital forensics
- [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) Crack some hashes online.
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) Helpful for encoding and decoding various forms of data.
